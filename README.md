## Description
The Beats Box EP-909 is a Drum Machine and rhythm composer capable of looping 5 percussion noises (high hat, bass, snare, bongo, and cymbal). After loading the page, the user can select where in the measure to play a sample on the 5x8 grid. After the user inputs their desired percussion composition, the beats per minute (BPM) field is filled with a numeric input between 60-600 and the "start" button is pressed. Voila! The sample loops until the user clicks the "stop" button. The existing loop can be modified, or, if the user wishes, the "clear" button can be clicked and the grid resets.
